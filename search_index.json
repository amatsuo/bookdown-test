You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). For now, you have to install the development versions of bookdown from Github: devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #.

If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 4. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 2.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 2.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 2.1: Here is a nice table!

Rroj file works only with the Preview version of RStudio. 8.2.1 Edit index.Rmd Following two lines in index.Rmd determine the style of book site: bookdown::bookdown_site output: bookdown::gitbook Options for theme of the book is avaialble here Other information (title, author etc) will be going this file as well. 8.2.2 Compile a book Use “Build book” in Build of RStudio. If you choose gitbook format, it will create a book in HTML format under _book folder. After compiling a book, a viewer for selected format will be opened. If you are working in an existing project and do not see the option of Build, go to “Project Options” and change the build tool to “Website”. “Build book” should take care of everything: Build a html book Generate a pdf-book through LaTeX Generate a epub book In order to check the output in a browser, open index.html in the _book folder. In browser preview, you can use edit function which redirects to a source of Rmd on github. The idea is that other conributors of the book edit source and send a pull-request. 8.2.3 Start a project from sratch Create a new project. Generate a new index.Rmd. The header should look like: --- title: &quot;Index&quot; author: &quot;Akitaka Matsuo&quot; date: &quot;24 October 2016&quot; output: bookdown::gitbook site: bookdown::bookdown_site --- 8.2.4 Adding chapters Add a new Rmd file (need to delete headers) 8.2.5 Referencing figures and tables \\@{fig:figname} and \\@{tab:tablename}. Fignames defined after the syntax highlighting methods in code-chunks, like {r nice-fig. Go Chater 1 to see working examples. 8.2.6 Align equation This syntax works: \\begin{align} a &amp;= b \\\\ c &amp;= d \\end{align} The code above creates following output \\[\\begin{align} a &amp;= b \\\\ c &amp;= d \\end{align}\\] 8.2.7 Resources More examples (e.g. shiny apps, widget) Video tutorials "]
